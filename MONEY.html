	It's the end of the month and the weekend<br>
	I'ma spend this check, everything on me, yeah<br>
	I'ma tip myself, I'ma spend it on myself<br>
	I'ma drop it like it's pouring, I'ma pour it on myself<br><br>

	Check, check, check<br>
	Check that money making bank account number (yikes)<br>
	That's that shit that's never getting bounced on ya<br>
	Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands<br>
	When the store says "Sign for it, " I'ma leave my autograph<br><br>

	Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>
	Watch it falling for me, I love the way that feels<br>
	Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>
	Keep on falling for me, I love the way it feels<br><br>

	I came here to drop some money, dropping all my money<br>
	Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah<br>
	Twerking, twerking when I buy the things I like<br>
	Dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight<br><br>

	Everyone silent, listen to my money talk<br>
	Spend how I like it<br>
	Yeah, everyone know what I mean, mean<br>
	When they see green, when they see green, that mean go<br>
	Give me what the hell I want<br>
	Give me what the hell I want<br><br>

	Check that money making bank account number (yikes)<br>
	That's that shit that's never getting bounced on ya<br>
	Bitch, I do the money dance, I just made a hundred bands<br>
	When the store says "Sign for it, " I'ma leave my autograph<br><br>

	Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>
	Watch it falling for me, I love the way that feels<br>
	Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>
	Keep on falling for me, I love the way it feels<br><br>

	I came here to drop some money, dropping all my money<br>
	Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah<br>
	Twerking, twerking when I buy the things I like<br>
	Dollar, dollars, dropping on my ass tonight<br><br>

	Drop some money, dropping all my money<br>
	Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah<br>
	Drop some money, dropping all my money<br>
	Drop some money, all this bread so yummy, yeah<br><br>

	My money moves, money, I choose<br>
	Celine, my shoes, walking on you<br>
	My money rules<br>
	My money moves, money, I choose<br>
	Watch how my Wons and Yens and Dollars be dropping on you, you, you<br><br>

	Dun, da, la, la, dun-dun, dun, da-la-la dun-dun<br>
	Dun, da, la, la, dun-dun, dropping on you<br>
	Dun, da, la, la, dun-dun, dun, da la la dun-dun<br>
	Dun, da, la, la, dun-dun, dropping on you
